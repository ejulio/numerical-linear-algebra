In *stochastic* gradient descent, we evaluate our loss function on just a sample of our data (sometimes called a *mini-batch*).

It turns out that this is still an effective way to optimize, and it's much more efficient!\n",

    "Above, we used our knowledge of what the gradient of the loss function was to do SGD from scratch in PyTorch.  However, PyTorch has an automatic differentiation package, [autograd](http://pytorch.org/docs/autograd.html) which we could use instead.  This is really useful, in that we can use autograd on problems where we don't know what the derivative is.  \n",
